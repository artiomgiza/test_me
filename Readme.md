---

This package helps us to calculate BBQ price for N people.

The total BBQ price is the combination of (see `coolPriceCalculator` implementation):
- meet price (beef or chicken if no beef available)
- mangal price
- coal price


Our purpose is to compare different kind of test approaches for the same code base.

We'll try to prepare best possible tests for the same `coolPriceCalculator` (see .../BBQ.go) with each approach.

Then compare and discuss.

Currently we have:
----
1. ginkgo example (./ginkgo_me/BBQ_test.go)
2. ...

How:
----
Please add directory in the project root, copy the `ginkgo_me/BBQ.go` file there and add tests.
